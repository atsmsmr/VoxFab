# VoxFab
VoxFab is a voxel based design software. This software is developed based on VoxCad(https://svn.code.sf.net/p/voxcad/code/VoxCad/) developed by Jonathan Hiller. 
VoxFab is composed of voxel based CAD and voxel based CAE. We are now developing VoxFab integrating voxel based CAM for 3D printing.

## FAV (fabricatable voxel) file format
VoxFab can import FAV (fabricatable voxel) file format. FAV file is new standard voxel based file format for 3D priting.
